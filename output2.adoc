=== Installing the AIX/VIOS Host Utilities

____
You must install the AIX Host Utilities Kit while using AIX MPIO with NetApp ONTAP Storage.

You can download the compressed file containing the Host Utilities software packages from the NetApp Support Site. After you have the file, you must uncompress it to get the two software packages you need to install the Host Utilities.

*Steps*
____

[arabic]
. Login to your host.
* On an AIX host, log in as *root*.
* On a PowerVM host, log in as *padmin*, and then enter the oem_setup_env command to become root.
. Download a copy of the compressed file containing the Host Utilities from NetApp Support Site to a directory on your host.
. Go to the directory containing the download.
. Uncompress the file and extract the SAN Toolkit software package.

____
zcat ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.0.tar.Z | tar -xvf –

The following directory is created when you uncompress the file: ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.0. This directory will have one of the following subdirectories: MPIO, NON_MPIO, or SAN_Tool_Kit
____

[arabic, start=5]
. Install the AIX MPIO:

____
installp -aXYd /var/tmp/ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.0/MPIO NetApp.MPIO_Host_Utilities_Kit
____

[arabic, start=6]
. Install the SAN Toolkit:

____
installp -aXYd /var/tmp/ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.0/SAN_Tool_Kit NetApp.SAN_toolkit
____

[arabic, start=7]
. Reboot the host.

=== SAN Toolkit

____
The toolkit is installed automatically when you install the NetApp Host Utilities package. This kit provides the sanlun utility, which helps you manage LUNs and HBAs. The sanlun command returns information about the LUNs mapped to your host, multipathing, and information necessary to create initiator groups.

*Example*

In the following example, the sanlun lun show command returns LUN information.

=== SAN Booting

____
*Before you begin*

If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=71102%3B&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp] https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=71102%3B&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[Interoperability Matrix Tool] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

SAN booting is the process of setting up a SAN-attached disk (a LUN) as a boot device for an AIX/PowerVM host. You can set up a SAN boot LUN to work in an AIX MPIO environment that is running the AIX Host Utilities with either the FC or FCoE protocol. The method you use for creating a SAN boot LUN and installing a new OS image on it in an AIX MPIO environment can vary, depending on which protocol you are using.
____

=== Multipathing

____
Multipathing allows you to configure multiple network paths between the host and storage system. If one path fails, traffic continues on the remaining paths. The AIX and PowerVM environments of the Host Utilities use AIX’s native multipathing solution (MPIO).

For AIX, Path Control Module (PCM) is responsible for controlling multiple paths. PCM is a storage vendor supplied code that handles path management. This gets installed and enabled as part of the Host Utilities installation.
____

==== Non-ASA Configuration

____
For non-ASA configuration there should be two groups of paths with different priorities. The paths with the higher priorities are Active/Optimized, meaning they are serviced by the controller where the aggregate is located. The paths with the lower priorities are active but are non-optimized because they are served from a different controller. The non-optimized paths are only used when no optimized paths are available.

*Example*

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths:

|up | |secondary | |path3 | |fcs1 | |fc_aix_4 | |1
|===

==== All SAN Array Configuration

____
In All SAN Array (ASA) configurations, all paths to a given Logical Unit (LUN) are active and optimized. This means I/O can be served through all paths at the same time, thereby enabling better performance.

*Example*

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN:

 All SAN Arrays (ASA) configurations are supported beginning in ONTAP 9.8 for AIX Hosts.

=== Recommended Settings for MetroCluster

____
By default, the AIX operating system enforces a shorter I/O timeout if when no paths to a LUN are available. This might occur in configurations including single-switch SAN fabric and MetroCluster configurations that experience unplanned failovers. For additional information and recommended changes to default settings, please refer to https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1001318[NetApp KB1001318]
